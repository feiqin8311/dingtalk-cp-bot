# DingTalk CP Bot

## Purpose

Use this skill when working on the `dingtalk-cp-bot` repository. The project is a DingTalk enterprise robot for logistics document checking: users send `SP...` shipment numbers, the bot queries LingXing, downloads FBA PDFs, OCRs the first page, checks destination FC/address consistency, and replies in DingTalk.

The source code is the highest authority. Read current files before making claims.

## First Steps

1. Inspect `AGENTS.md` first. It points to external project memory under `/home/yida/Project/ai-memory/projects/dingtalk-cp-bot/`.
2. Read the smallest useful source set:
   - `README.md` for setup and current behavior.
   - `app.py` for startup.
   - `config.py` for environment variables.
   - `handler.py` for message flow and business logic.
   - `address_book_source.py` for local/SMB Excel loading.
   - `usage_state.py` for in-memory deduplication and shipment locks.
3. Never print or copy full secrets from `.env`, OpenClaw config, or auth files. Show only `SET`/`MISSING` or masked values.
4. If changing behavior, add or update focused tests under `tests/` and run verification before reporting success.

## Current Architecture

- `app.py`: starts DingTalk Stream client and registers `ShipmentQueryHandler`.
- `config.py`: loads `.env` and exposes DingTalk, LingXing, OCR, SMB, download, and DB settings.
- `handler.py`: parses DingTalk messages, queues jobs, queries LingXing, downloads PDFs, runs OCR, matches FC/address, replies, and logs usage.
- `address_book_source.py`: opens `files/全站点地址.xlsx` from a local path, `smb://...`, or Windows UNC path.
- `usage_state.py`: process-local message deduplication and shipment locks.
- `tests/`: unit tests for address-book source loading and runtime state.

Detailed project notes are in `references/project-brief.md`; read it when you need more than this quick overview.

## Data And State

The database is intentionally minimal. MySQL is only used to record who used the bot:

- Required table: `fact_bot_cp_call_log`
- Stored fields: `user_id`, `user_name`, `message_text`, plus `created_at`
- Message deduplication and shipment locks are in memory, not in MySQL.

Do not recreate removed state tables unless the user explicitly asks for cross-process or multi-instance locking.

## Address Book

The address book can be local or SMB-backed.

Preferred SMB shape:

```env
ADDRESS_BOOK_XLSX_PATH=smb://192.168.0.45/供应链管理/2 物流发货管理/17.单证数据表维护/全站点地址.xlsx
SMB_USERNAME=...
SMB_PASSWORD=...
SMB_PORT=445
SMB_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
SMB_CLIENT_NAME=dingtalk-cp-bot
```

The code also supports Windows UNC paths such as `\\host\share\path\file.xlsx`.

Do not expose the real SMB password in responses or generated docs.

## Common Workflows

### Verify The Project

Use a container when the host Python lacks dependencies:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -v "$PWD":/app -w /app python:3.11-slim-bookworm sh -lc \
  "pip install -q -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.org/simple && \
   python -m unittest tests.test_address_book_source tests.test_usage_state -v && \
   python -m py_compile app.py config.py handler.py address_book_source.py usage_state.py"
```

For a quick local test that needs no external dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_usage_state -v
```

### Check SMB Address Book Access

Use `.env` values through `config`; do not echo secrets:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import config
from address_book_source import open_address_book_workbook
result = open_address_book_workbook(
    path=config.ADDRESS_BOOK_XLSX_PATH,
    smb_host=config.SMB_HOST,
    smb_share=config.SMB_SHARE,
    smb_username=config.SMB_USERNAME,
    smb_password=config.SMB_PASSWORD,
    smb_port=config.SMB_PORT,
    smb_timeout_sec=config.SMB_TIMEOUT_SEC,
    smb_client_name=config.SMB_CLIENT_NAME,
)
try:
    print(result.workbook.sheetnames)
finally:
    result.close()
PY
```

### Check Database Usage Logging

Only verify `fact_bot_cp_call_log` unless the task asks otherwise:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = DATABASE()
  AND table_name = 'fact_bot_cp_call_log';
```

## Editing Rules

- Keep changes scoped. `handler.py` is large; avoid broad refactors unless needed for the requested behavior.
- Preserve local-file address book compatibility when changing SMB logic.
- Preserve in-memory dedup/lock behavior unless the user asks for multi-instance support.
- Do not store PDFs, OCR text, or detailed match results in MySQL unless explicitly requested.
- Update `README.md`, `env.example`, Docker copy rules, and tests when adding files or config keys.
- Run `git diff --check` before finalizing code changes.

## OpenClaw Context

The machine may have OpenClaw and a DingTalk connector configured. Treat this as operational context, not as part of the bot service unless the user asks about OpenClaw.

Useful checks:

```bash
openclaw --version
openclaw agents list
openclaw channels list
systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway.service --no-pager
```

Mask app secrets and auth tokens in any output.
